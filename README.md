# pi-haiku
Scrape a random haiku from the web and display it on a waveshare e-paper hat.

Depends on module-specific files from https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper.

These hats are neat. I decided to do something funny with mine. I told my little pi zero-w to run this script every 15 minutes to grab a new random haiku and display it on the e-paper hat. Nothing magic. The original script was my very first foray into Python. This script has been tidied up a little and converted to Python 3. It shouldn't bite... :)
